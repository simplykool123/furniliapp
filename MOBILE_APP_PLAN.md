```

### API Integration Strategy
**Existing Web API Compatibility:**
- Reuse all existing `/api/*` endpoints
- Add mobile-specific endpoints for photo uploads
- Implement incremental data sync endpoints
- Add push notification registration

**Mobile-Specific Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/mobile/photos/upload    # Photo upload with metadata
GET  /api/mobile/sync/delta       # Incremental data sync
POST /api/mobile/push/register    # Push notification setup
GET  /api/mobile/offline/package  # Offline data package
```

### Offline Data Strategy
**SQLite Schema (Mobile):**
```sql
-- Core entities for offline access
CREATE TABLE projects_cache (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  data TEXT, -- JSON data
  last_modified INTEGER,
  sync_status TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE inventory_cache (
  product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  current_stock INTEGER,
  last_updated INTEGER,
  pending_changes TEXT -- JSON array
);

CREATE TABLE photos_queue (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  project_id INTEGER,
  file_path TEXT,
  metadata TEXT, -- JSON metadata
  upload_status TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER
);
```

## Mobile-Specific Features

### Camera Integration
**Site Documentation:**
- Project progress photos with automatic GPS tagging
- Before/after comparison views
- OCR integration for reading material labels
- Automatic photo compression and optimization

**Inventory Management:**
- Barcode scanning for quick product lookup
- Photo verification for stock movements
- Damage documentation with photos
- Material condition assessment

### Offline Capabilities
**Critical Offline Functions:**
- View recent project data (last 30 days)
- Record inventory movements with photo proof
- Create material requests (sync when online)
- Access contact information and project details

**Smart Sync Strategy:**
- Priority-based upload (critical data first)
- Batch operations to minimize battery usage
- Conflict resolution with user approval
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Push Notifications
